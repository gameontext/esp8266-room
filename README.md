# esp8266-room

A simple bit of code using the Arduino Json Library, and the Arduino Web Socket library, to create a Game-On room that can run on ESP8266 hardware. 

This room is built to run on a Witty - http://www.aliexpress.com/item/ESP8266-serial-WIFI-Witty-cloud-Development-Board-ESP-12F-module-MINI-nodemcu/32566502491.html

Although with minor changes it should work on any ESP8266.

The room allows players to read & alter the rgb led on the Witty board, and read the LDR, and state of the Button.
